**Introduction to web development - task 3**

Show that you can create a simple web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In HTML it should say "Hello World" in an H1 element.

Under H1 there should be a button that can be clicked on. 

With CSS, the text in H1 should be set to the color blue (or any other non-black color of your choice).

With JavaScript, a click on the button should cause the text in the H1 element to be changed to "Goodbye World".
